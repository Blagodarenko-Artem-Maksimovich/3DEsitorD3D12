# 3D Editor (D3D12 & C++)

## Overview
This project is a 3D Editor built using Direct3D 12 (D3D12) and C++. It provides a platform for rendering and manipulating 3D objects with real-time rendering capabilities.

## Features
- **Real-time 3D rendering** using Direct3D 12
- **Texture and material support**
- **Camera controls** (orbit, pan, zoom)

## TODO
- **Scene management** for handling multiple objects
- **Camera controls** (orbit, pan, zoom)
- **Model import/export** support (OBJ, FBX, etc.)

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2019/2022
- DirectX 12 SDK
- C++17 or later
- [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) (for model loading)
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (for UI rendering)

## Usage
- **Load a model**: Drag and drop an OBJ or FBX file into the editor.
- **Navigate the scene**: Use WASD for movement, mouse for rotation.
- **Modify objects**: Select an object and use transformation controls.
- **Change materials**: Adjust textures, shaders, and lighting settings.
- **Export**: Save your scene as a project file.
